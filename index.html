            <p class="question">Who are we?</p>
            <p>We are Lebanon Trail High School BPA. We are a group of future leaders and businesspeople from Lebanon
                Trail High School in Frisco, Texas. Our program has been running strong since 2018 and has sent dozens
                of students to both state and national conferences. We were also named <a
                    href="https://twitter.com/LebanonTrailHS/status/1236657507935846400">best BPA chapter in the

            <p class="question">What is BPA?</p>
            <!-- <p>

            <p>BPA is a career and technical student organization targeted at students pursuing careers in business,
                information technology, finance, accounting, and much more. Students develop their leadership, academic,
                and technological skills, participate in their own school's BPA business-related events and meetings,
                and
                compete against other aspiring, young businessmen and businesswomen at the regional, state, and national
                level. The skills you learn in BPA are designed to be directly applicable to your future career.</p>

            <p class="question">Why should you join BPA?</p>
            <p>In addition to allowing you to explore what careers fields you might be interested in, BPA allows
                you to develop valuable life skills as well. From public speaking to innovation to networking,
                involvement in BPA is definitely something that will stand out on your college application. Apart from
                other high school level organizations and clubs, BPA prepares you for both the real and professional
                worlds. In addition to this, BPA is a fun experience! We go off-campus for several reasons - we go on a
                yearly joint trip with DECA to visit the Mavericks in Dallas, and have regional and state competitions
                as well (talk to any of the BPA officers - the state competitions are something you don’t want to miss!)
                If you are interested, don’t hesitate to reach out to Dr. Williams, Coach Loosli, or any of the BPA
                officers!</p>
